## introduction

### motivation

* telematics is transportation and processing of information and advanced telecommunication services - long distance data exchange
* transport telematics is acquisition, processing and transmission of transport relevant data and information
* application: traffic guidance systems, driver assistance systems
* why transport telematics: ensure mobility
  * enhancement of safety
  * increase of efficency
  * reduction of adverse impacts on environment

### obstacles for transpot telematics

* supply of necessary data with sufficient quality
* organizational and legal barriers/vagueness
* refinancing of development costs of telematic systems
* cost-covering operation of telematic services
* missing harmonisation and standardisation
adverse impacts due to incresing complexity and cross-linking of the components

### intelligent transport systems(ITS)

add information and communication technologies to transport infrastructure and vehicles

### Functional architecture of a navigation system

### data & information

data: a formalized collection of facts, concepts, and instructions, usable for communication or processing by humans or automated methods  

information: purpose-oriented knowledge necessary for acting to reach the intended aims
