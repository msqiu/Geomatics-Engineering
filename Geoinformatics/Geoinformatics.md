## Introduction
### geographical information system(GIS) - IMAP of spatial data/geodata  
computer-based systems for the acquisition and update,  storage and query, analyses and simulation as well as output and presentation of spatial data  
* acquisition and update - input
* storage and query - management
* analyses and simulation - analyses
* output and presentation - presentation
### geodata: data elements which are referenced to a part of the earth
* satellite data
* aerial data
* topographic maps
* street network data - navigation systems
* thematic maps - represent information
* cadastre data
* 3D city models
### GeoTIFF: special form of tiff  
contain information about the **georeferencing** of the image and other infomation, e.g., map projection
### GIS-Environments LNSED
* Land Information Systems(LIS): systems which are developed and operated by state surveying institutes
* Network Information Systems(NIS): Facility management of networks (for example from energy, water and gas supply companies)
* Space Information Systems(SIS): systems for the decision support for planning and development
* Environmental Information Systems(EIS)
* Domain Information Systems(DIS): systems which have special applications
### What can I do with a GIS: planning, presentation, navigation, simulation, management of geodata

## Data Acquisition

### Primary data acquisition: acquisition **directly** from the object or from an image from it
* Geodesy: measurement with theodolite, total station, gps-receiver,...
* Photogrammetry: Reconstruction of objects regarding their form and position from photographic images
  * Aerial film camera with FMC(Foward motion compensation)
    * Film format 230 x 230 mm
    * Imaging at 60-90% overlap along strip, 10-30% across strip
    * example: v = 70 m/s = 250km/h, m=1:13.000, T = 1/1000 s, FMC = 70m/s * 1/1000s / 13.000 = 0.05mm

### Secondary data acquisition: acquisition of already interpreted data

### Geo basis data

## Data Modeling

### Geometrical Data Modeling

### Topological Data Modeling

### Thematic Data Modeling

### Data Structures

## Data Analysis
