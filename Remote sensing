## Introduction

Remote Sensing means the sensing of the Earth's surface from space by making use of the properties of electromagnetic waves emitted, reflected or diffracted by the sensed objects, for the purpose of improving natural resources management, land use and the protection of the environment.

Remote Sensing uses the radiant energy that is reflected, emitted or scattered from the earth and its atmosphere from various portions of the electromagnetic(EM) spectrum.
