## Introduction
A map is a planar, full-scale, generalized and content limited model of spatial information  
Cartography is a discipline, dealing with the conception, the production, the distribution and the field of study of maps.  

### Tasks of cartography
* Processing and transfer of spatial related information(interpretation, choice, generalization, presentation)  
* Compilation, design
* Realization, distribution

### Classification of maps
* Kind of realization
  * Analogue
  * Digital
* Producer
  * Official
  * Private
* Way of origin
  * Base map
    * the base maps deliever a part of thematic data
    * further data can be collected from other sources
  * Derived map
* Size of map scale
  * Large scales: >1:10,000
  * Medium scales: 1:10,000 ~ 1:300,000
  * Small scales: <1:300,000
* Content
  * Topographic map
  * Thematic map
      * Analytical and synthetic
      * Primary and derived(source) maps
      * Concrete and abstract maps
      * Inductive and deductive maps
      * Representation of unchangeable and changeable issues
      * Representation of bounded and continuous issues
      * Map and cartograms
      * Large scale and small scale maps
      * Single maps, map series, atlases
* Map types(method-oriented structure): Point maps, isopleth maps, areal maps, signature maps, diagram maps...

### Maps are never completely objective but they should transfer the highest level of objectivity - due to the different methods of generalization for map visualization

### geodata
Data about objects, land forms and infrastructure on the earth's surface, resource.
* Essential characteristic - spatial relation
  * Geo data can be linked by its spatial relation
  * New information can be derived by using gis functionalities
  * Queries, analysis, and processing of certain questions and problems
* Describe the land scape's objects
* Two partitions
  * Geo/spatial base data
  * Geo/spatial thematic data
* Describes objects, directly(coordinates) or indirectly(relationship) referenceable by its position in space
* Information technology, geo data - combination of data
  * Geometric data(position and shape of objects)
  * Topology(spatial relations)
  * Graphic representation
  * Thematic data, attributes
* Geoinformation is a property, which has to be provided, administrated and maintained (to guarantee up-to-dateness)
* Geo information has to be managed. Besides the actual core data, metadata has to be provided as well
* specific and unique characteristics
  * Spatial relation: The information has a spatial location, e.g. by coordinates, addresses, indices or other forms of spatial reference
  * Portable: unbounded usage through world-wide networks
  * Divisibility: Information can be sent out and can be received
  * Extensibility: Value of information increases with frequency of usage
  * Compressibility: Information can be aggregated to support different application levels
